# PHP Script Example
This example is a simple PHP script using the JPush API PHP Client. It has an example composer.json that fetches the library from Packagist.

## Setup

 1. Use composer to fetch the library and dependencies defined in `composer.json`, and install them:

```
$ composer install
#or
$ php composer.phar install
```

 2. Edit the script, or copy it, and replace the `$appkey` and `$masterSecret`.
 3. Run the script `PushExample.php` and `ReportExample.php`
